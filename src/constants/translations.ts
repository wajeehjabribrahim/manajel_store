      storyPara1: "The idea of Manajel was born from the land... from among the olive trees that have accompanied us for years and were part of our daily life and our family's history. For us, olive oil was not just a product, but a story of hard work and seasons, the aroma of mills, and harvest memories where family and friends gathered.",
      storyPara2: "Over time, we realized that what we have is not only high-quality olive oil, but a complete experience that deserves to reach every home. From here began the journey of Manajel; a journey aimed at delivering the authenticity of the land and the purity of the product to our customers in a modern and easy way.",
      storyPara3: "We care for every step in our journey — from caring for the trees, to harvesting, to pressing and packaging — to ensure that you receive natural olive oil that carries the true taste we believe in and are proud to offer.",
      storyPara4: "Manajel is not just a mill, but an extension of land, identity, and a message: that the goodness given by nature remains present on your tables as we experience it every season.",

      storyPara1: "وُلدت فكرة مناجل من الأرض… من بين أشجار الزيتون التي رافقتنا لسنوات وكانت جزءًا من يومنا وتاريخ عائلتنا. لم يكن الزيت بالنسبة لنا مجرد منتج، بل حكاية تعبٍ ومواسم، ورائحة معاصر، وذكريات قطاف اجتمع فيها الأهل والأصدقاء.",
      storyPara2: "مع مرور الوقت، أدركنا أن ما نملكه ليس فقط زيت زيتون عالي الجودة، بل تجربة كاملة تستحق أن تصل إلى كل بيت. من هنا بدأت رحلة مناجل؛ رحلة هدفها نقل أصالة الأرض ونقاء المنتج إلى عملائنا بطريقة عصرية وسهلة.",
      storyPara3: "نعتني بكل خطوة في رحلتنا — من العناية بالأشجار، إلى القطاف، إلى العصر والتعبئة — لنضمن أن يصل إليكم زيت زيتون طبيعي يحمل الطعم الحقيقي الذي نؤمن به ونفخر بتقديمه.",
